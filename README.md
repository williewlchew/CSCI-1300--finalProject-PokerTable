# CSCI-1300--finalProject-PokerTable
Poker Table is a C++ program that simulates a game of poker with a computer run opponent. The game of poker is built with 
classes Card.cpp and Deck.cpp and organized by the Dealer.cpp. The algorithm used to control the computer is stored in the 
Player.cpp file. The algorithm checks the value of its hand by comparing its cards to the cards on the table. The value
calculated will be used to find a probability of actions that the computer will execute. The probability element of the 
algorithm is supposed to simulate the element of unpredictability of poker.

Using the program is quite simple as the user will be prompted the options avaliable to the user. The user type in the action
